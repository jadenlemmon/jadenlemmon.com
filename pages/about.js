            <span>Hey I'm Jaden.</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm an Oklahoma native and have lived in Oklahoma my whole life. My
            professional career spans 8+ years while my interest in Web
            Development started long before that. Since writing my first webpage
            in notepad while in the 4th grade, I knew exactly what I wanted to
            do. I started picking up freelance clients while in high school
            which led me to jump into my first full-time role at a great
            organization in my home town Enid, OK.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a successful 3 years, I felt the need to pursue my career
            further with a move to start a role with one of the largest
            internationally known non-profits. I then continued to pursue my
            career with a gaming company based in Atlanta, GA and then working
            for a large non-profit organization funded by one of the most well
            known retail store chains in the USA.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though I chose Web Development as my focus, I still enjoy a
            number of other related topics such as video production, graphic
            design, print design, and marketing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've spent my entire life devoted to what I do but I still try to
            have fun too. While I'm not in the office, I try to do as much
            outdoors as I can. I enjoy anything from cycling, running, hiking,
            and mostly anything else that you can do outside.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also enjoy to travel. Anytime I get the opportunity to travel out
            of state you can count me in.
